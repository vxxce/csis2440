      Hi! I'm Zachary. I'm a first-semester student in the CSIS program at Salt Lake Community College.
      I also have a degree in Psychology from the University of Utah.
      I have taught myself a small bit of programming in my own time
      (mostly in Python and Javascript) but am otherwise new to world
      of Computer Science. You can view a few of my personal projects on
      my <a href="https://github.com/vxxce/">Github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a painter! I'm more of a hobbyist than a professional,
      but you can see my work on display now at the Bountiful Davis Art Center.
      The solo show is called <em>Having Been Utterly Persuaded By a Stone</em>
      and will be up until Feb. 14th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my other hobbies include the board game "Go" (AKA Baduk or Weiqi),
      photography, camping, bookbinding, and cycling. I could never settle on
      a favorite film or book but the first two that come to mind are, respectively,
      <em>Waking Life</em> and <em>Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst</em>.
