{<p><b>Description</b>: Elves are a slender race, with both genders
standing around five feet tall and weighing around 130
pounds. Most have dark hair, with little or no body or
facial hair. Their skin is pale, and they have pointed ears
and delicate features. Elves are lithe and graceful. They
have keen eyesight and hearing. Elves are typically
inquisitive, passionate, self-assured, and sometimes
haughty. Their typical lifespan is a dozen centuries or
more.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: Elves may become Clerics, Fighters, MagicUsers
or Thieves; they are also allowed to combine the
classes of Fighter and Magic-User, and of Magic-User and
Thief (see Combination Classes, below). They are
required to have a minimum Intelligence of 9. Due to their
generally delicate nature, they may not have a
Constitution higher than 17. Elves never roll larger than
six-sided dice (d6) for hit points.</p>
<p><b>Special Abilities</b>: All Elves have Darkvision with a 60'
range. They are able to find secret doors more often than
normal (1-2 on 1d6 rather than the usual 1 on 1d6). An
Elf is so observant that one has a 1 on 1d6 chance to find
a secret door with a cursory look. Elves are immune to
the paralyzing attack of ghouls. Also, they are less likely to
be surprised in combat, reducing the chance of surprise by
1 in 1d6.</p>
<p><b>Saving Throws</b>: Elves save at +1 vs. Paralysis or Petrify,
and +2 vs. Magic Wands and Spells.</p>}
 
{<p><b>Description</b>: Dwarves are a short, stocky race; both male
and female Dwarves stand around four feet tall and
typically weigh around 120 pounds. Their long hair and
thick beards are dark brown, gray or black. They take
great pride in their beards, sometimes braiding or forking
them. They have a fair to ruddy complexion. Dwarves
have stout frames and a strong, muscular build. They are
rugged and resilient, with the capacity to endure great
hardships. Dwarves are typically practical, stubborn and
courageous. They can also be introspective, suspicious
and possessive. They have a lifespan of three to four
centuries.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: Dwarves may become Clerics, Fighters, or
Thieves. They are required to have a minimum
Constitution of 9. Due to their generally dour dispositions,
they may not have a Charisma higher than 17. They may
not employ Large weapons more than four feet in length
(specifically, two-handed swords, polearms, and
longbows).</p>
<p><b>Special Abilities</b>: All Dwarves have Darkvision with a 60'
range, and are able to detect slanting passages, traps,
shifting walls and new construction on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6;
a search must be performed before this roll may be made.</p>
<p><b>Saving Throws: Dwarves save at +4 vs. Death Ray or
Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and
at +3 vs. Dragon Breath.</p>}
 
{<p><b>Description</b>: Halflings are small, slightly stocky folk who
stand around three feet tall and weigh about 60 pounds.
They have curly brown hair on their heads and feet, but
rarely have facial hair. They are usually fair skinned, often
with ruddy cheeks. Halflings are remarkably rugged for
their small size. They are dexterous and nimble, capable
of moving quietly and remaining very still. They usually
go barefoot. Halflings are typically outgoing, unassuming
and good-natured. They live about a hundred years.</p>
<p><b>Restrictions</b>: Halflings may become Clerics, Fighters or
Thieves. They are required to have a minimum Dexterity
of 9. Due to their small stature, they may not have a
Strength higher than 17. Halflings never roll larger than
six-sided dice (d6) for hit points regardless of class.
Halflings may not use Large weapons, and must wield
Medium weapons with both hands.</p>
<p><b>Special Abilities</b>: Halflings are unusually accurate with all
sorts of ranged weapons, gaining a +1 attack bonus when
employing them. When attacked in melee by creatures
larger than man-sized, Halflings gain a +2 bonus to their
Armor Class. Halflings are quick-witted, thus adding +1 to
Initiative die rolls. Outdoors in their preferred forest
terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as
they remain still there is only a 10% chance they will be
detected. Even indoors, in dungeons or in non-preferred
terrain they are able to hide such that there is only a 30%
chance of detection. Note that a Halfling Thief will roll
only once, using either the Thief ability or the Halfling
ability, whichever is better.</p>
<p><b>Saving Throws</b>: Halflings save at +4 vs. Death Ray or
Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, and Spells, and
at +3 vs. Dragon Breath.</p>}
