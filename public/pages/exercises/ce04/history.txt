was the youngest person ever to be accepted into the academy.
failed the entrance exam 3 times before passing the 4th with a perfect score.
first encountered J. L. Vance (who would eventually become a life-long nemesis) during this time.
missed a semester due to illness that the Captain would later describe as "absolutely horrific, but profoundly important".
graduated in just 2 years--a previously unheard of accomplishment.
visited daily with Daniel D. Lewis in the cafeteria for lunch.
developed a notoriety for pulling off incredible and sometimes legally questionable exploits.

exhibited severe behavioral problems that some say are bound to resurface, despite the captain's apparent congeniality.
spent weeks trying to get the unusual nickname "D3V3RT3R" to stick. Several active forums still use this identifier for the Captain.
took an unapproved semester off-world in defiance of Academy directives. Nobody knows how this time was spent and the Academy continues to deny it ever happened at all.
admitted having drank 3 gallons of milk in a strange and unsuccessful attempt to impress another pupil. Witnesses frequently describe the event as either heroically bewildering or bewilderingly heroic.
